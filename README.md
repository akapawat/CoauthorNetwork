# Co-authors Network
A simple Python program to generate a directed co-author network in a heirachical way i.e. the authors is connected with a directed edge to their top-n co-authors. The network is built from a source author with controlable depth and bredth using Scholarly and NetworkX library. The output is written in .gxef format which can be visualized in Gephi.
Feel free to contact me for any problems or improvements.

Here is an example of co-author network visualized in Gephi. Node sizes are scaled with h-index.
